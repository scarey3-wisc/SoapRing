# SoapRing
The source code can be found in:
tests/SoapRing/main.cpp
The USDA output file can be found in
build/tests/SoapRing/soap-ring.usda
This project was built and tested on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2019.

The code itself is unimportant, because it generates the same USDA simulation file every time. 

USDView software is required to visualize the simulation file.
